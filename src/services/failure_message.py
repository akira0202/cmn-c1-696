"""AgentCore Platform v1.0 — caller-facing wording for a failed run.

A failed run reaches the caller as a terminal failure whose text the platform runner produces: it
names the exception type and nothing else. The rejecting node therefore sends the reason itself, as
a non-terminal event, before returning the error — and it has to happen there, because once a run
carries ``status: error`` the framework skips ``execute()`` on every later node.

The wording is written for the person who sent the request, so it does not reuse the node's own
reason text: that text is written for an operator reading a log and names internal state keys and
design terms. Each sentence says what to change, or says the condition is not theirs to change, so
a caller does not keep editing a request that was never the problem.

``explain`` derives the sentence from the allowlisted rejection code the node already computes for
its audit event. Only the field name carried in that code is ever substituted — the field name the
caller themselves sent — so no request value can appear. ``test_failure_message`` asserts it.
