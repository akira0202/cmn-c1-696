# CMN-C1-696 — Unit Tests: caller-facing wording for a failed run (src/services/failure_message.py)
#
# A failed run reaches the caller naming only the exception type, so these sentences are the only
# thing that tells them whether to edit the request or to raise it with whoever runs the deployment.
# Getting that distinction wrong is worse than being vague: it sends the caller back to edit a
# request that was never the problem.
